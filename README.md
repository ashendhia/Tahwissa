# Tahwissa

Algeria E-Tourism Website

The Tahwissa aims to encourage Tourism in Algeria, as it consists of a Tourism Website named Tahwissa for Visitors from all around the world, as well as the local Visitors to discover the beauty of Algeria, and it provides the users with the needed information about the known Touristic Sites and Trips on the different Regions of Algeria.

On top of the Tahwissa Website, there’s a Dashboard Website dedicated to the ministry of tourism and handicrafts to handle the different Touristic Sites and Trips with the controls being: Create, Update, and Delete.

The final product is only a Demo version, as the Data displayed on both Websites is limited, the concerned Region is l’Oranie, and the Wilaya of Oran exactly.
